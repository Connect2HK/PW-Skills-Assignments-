    <h1>Full Stack Web Development Tech Stacks</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>MEAN Stack</strong>
            <p>A JavaScript-based stack consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. Used for building dynamic single-page applications and APIs.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>MERN Stack</strong>
            <p>Similar to the MEAN stack but uses React instead of Angular for the front-end framework. Itâ€™s used for building modern web applications with a reactive user interface.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>LAMP Stack</strong>
            <p>Comprises Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. It's a classic stack for developing and deploying web applications with a focus on server-side scripting.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>LEMP Stack</strong>
            <p>A variation of the LAMP stack that uses Nginx (pronounced "Engine-X") instead of Apache. It's known for high performance and scalability.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>JAMstack</strong>
            <p>Stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It's a modern approach to building websites where the front-end is decoupled from the back-end, relying on static site generators and APIs.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Serverless Stack</strong>
            <p>Uses serverless computing services such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions. It focuses on building applications without managing servers, relying on cloud providers to handle infrastructure.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Spring Boot + Angular/React</strong>
            <p>Combines Spring Boot, a Java-based framework for building microservices and APIs, with Angular or React for the front-end. It's used for enterprise-level web applications.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Django + React/Vue</strong>
            <p>Pairs Django, a Python-based web framework, with React or Vue.js for the front-end. It's used for building robust web applications with a focus on rapid development and a clean separation of concerns.</p>
        </li>
